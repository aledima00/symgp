# symgp
Python Symbolic regression with Genetic Programming.

## Overview

`symgp` is a Python library for symbolic regression using genetic programming. It allows users to evolve mathematical expressions to fit given data. The library leverages the power of genetic algorithms to automatically discover mathematical models that best describe the provided data.

## Installation

### Using pip

You can install `symgp` using pip from the GitHub repository:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/aledima00/symgp.git
```

### Using Poetry

You can install `symgp` using Poetry from the GitHub repository:

```sh
poetry add git+https://github.com/aledima00/symgp.git
```

### From Source

To install `symgp` from source, clone the repository and install it using Poetry (`poetry` is required):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aledima00/symgp.git
cd symgp
poetry install
```

## Usage

You can use APIs in different abstraction levels, as each class has its own purpose and it is documented in this repo.
For example, have a look at this tree generation and relative print:

```python
import symgp
from symgp import IndividualTree, Node,Leaf,VarLeaf,SpecialLeaf
from symgp import npf

# we want to represent: ((x+y)^2)/2*pi*z

# create the var leaves
x = VarLeaf("x")
y = VarLeaf("y")
z = VarLeaf("z")

# create the nodes
n1 = Node(npf.add, [x,y])
n2 = Node(npf.pow, [n1,Leaf(2)])
d1 = Node(npf.mul, [Leaf(2),SpecialLeaf("pi")])
d2 = Node(npf.mul, [d1,z])
rt = Node(npf.div, [n2,d2])

# create the individual tree
ind = IndividualTree(rt)

# print the expression
print(ind.fstr())

# print the tree
print(ind.tree_fstr())
```

the associated output is the following

showing both *LISP* and tree representations.

> notice that in all the repo, the `fstr()` and `tree_fstr()` format are used as in this case, and they exploit the `Formatted` class from my `consoleformat` library (https://github.com/aledima00/ConsoleFormat). 

### Basic Example

Here is a basic example of how to use `symgp` to perform symbolic regression:

```python
import numpy as np
from symgp import BaseModel

# Load your data
X = np.random.rand(1, 100)  # Example input data
Y = np.sin(X)  # Example output data

# Define the input variable names
LEAVES_NAMES = [f"x[{i}]" for i in range(X.shape[0])]

# some generation params
generation_params = {
    "int_constants":True, # use int as random constants
    "randc_mean":0, # mean of random constants
    "randc_std":5, # stddev of random constants
    "ctv_prop":0.3, # ratio of constants to input variables
    "stv_prop":0.1, # ratio of special constants (pi,e,...) to normal ones
    "unary_to_others_prop":0.5 # ratio of unary operators to normal ones
}

# Initialize the model
model = BaseModel(
    max_depth=8,
    population_size=1000,
    input_leaves_names=LEAVES_NAMES,
    rand_seed=1234567890,
    generation_params=generation_params
)

# Populate the initial population
model.populate()

# Evolve the population
model.evolve(X,Y, 
    generations=10,
    mutation_rate=0.1,
    elitism_rate=0.02,
    pool_size=2,
    parsimonyweight=0.1,
    parsimony_format='bilinear'
)

# Get the best individual
best_individual = model.population()[0]

# Print the best individual and its fitness
print("Best individual:", best_individual.fstr())
print("Fitness:", best_individual.fitness(X, Y, LEAVES_NAMES))
```

## Library Components

### Core Classes

#### **Operator**

The `Operator` class represents a mathematical operator used in the symbolic expressions. It is basically a wrapper around an actual function that includes some metadata and some addded functionalities.

- **Methods:**
  - `__init__(self, name: str, arity: int, func: Callable, expr: str = None, *, simplify_func: Callable[[List], Tuple['Operator', List]] = None)`: Initializes the operator.
    - `name`: The name of the operator, short for tree and LISP representation.
    - `arity`: The number of arguments the operator takes.
    - `func`: The function implemented and wrapped by the operator.
    - `expr`: The string representation of the operator as to be written in an actual python function; it uses `#N` placeholders to indicate args, like `np.add(#1,#2)`; when not provided, it uses the syntax `np.name(...)`, using the `self.name` parameter and the `self.arity` to write placeholders;
    - `simplify_func`: A function to simplify expressions involving this operator. When called on some params, it returns a tuple with a simplified operator or constant leaf, and eventually children as list of subset of items from input args; it returns `None` when no simplification can be done; for example, to simplify a sum we can apply the function `lambda a,b: mul(2,a) if a==b else None`
  - `__call__(self, *args)`: Applies the operator to the given arguments.
  - `simplified(self, in_lst: List) -> Tuple['Operator', List]`: Simplifies the operator with the given arguments, calling the function provided in initialization to the constructor;
  - `solved_expr(self, args: list) -> str`: Returns the string representation of the operator with the given arguments, replacing the placeholders are substituted with actual data privded by `args`

#### **BaseModel**

The `BaseModel` is simply a wrapper around the `Model` class, that uses `npf` functions as the input of `Fset` of the model, so that there is no need to indicate manually all the operators.

### npf

The `npf` module provides a set of predefined operators and functions that can be used to build symbolic expressions. These operators are wrappers around common NumPy functions, allowing for seamless integration with the `symgp` library.

All the operators can be accessed under the scope `npf`, under `symgp`.

These operators can be used to construct complex mathematical expressions within the genetic programming framework provided by `symgp`.

#### Example Usage

Here is an example of how to use the `npf` operators to create a symbolic expression:

```python
from symgp import Node, Leaf, VarLeaf
from symgp import npf

# Create variable leaves
x = VarLeaf("x")
y = VarLeaf("y")

# Create nodes using npf operators
n1 = Node(npf.add, [x, y])
n2 = Node(npf.pow, [n1, Leaf(2)])
n3 = Node(npf.sin, [n2])

# Print the expression
print(n3.fstr())
```
